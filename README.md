# iML Application Report

## I. Supervised - Classification (Pancreatic Cancer Dataset)

### A. Project Code File
- [Project Code Link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/119S3ch7tW3FFb1rI8zv760K_-ooRgp1q?usp=sharing)

### B. Dataset Information
This dataset contains records of 590 patients, including details such as age, sex, and various biomarkers.

### C. Compare 2 Models (CART and CatBoost)
#### 1. Evaluation Metrics
- **Accuracy**:
  - CART Accuracy: 0.8898 (88.98%)
  - CatBoost Accuracy: 0.9576 (95.76%)

- **Confusion Matrices**:
  - CART:
    ```
    Class 1: 40 true positives, 3 false negatives
    Class 2: 33 true positives, 6 false negatives
    Class 3: 32 true positives, 4 false negatives
    ```
  - CatBoost:
    ```
    Class 1: 43 true positives, 0 false negatives, 0 false positives
    Class 2: 37 true positives, 2 false negatives, 0 false positives
    Class 3: 33 true positives, 2 false negatives, 1 false positive
    ```

#### 2. Classification Reports
- **CART**:
  ```
  Class 1: Precision = 1.00, Recall = 0.93, F1-score = 0.96
  Class 2: Precision = 0.82, Recall = 0.85, F1-score = 0.84
  Class 3: Precision = 0.84, Recall = 0.89, F1-score = 0.86
  ```

- **CatBoost**:
  ```
  Class 1: Precision = 0.98, Recall = 1.00, F1-score = 0.99
  Class 2: Precision = 0.95, Recall = 0.95, F1-score = 0.95
  Class 3: Precision = 0.94, Recall = 0.92, F1-score = 0.93
  ```

### D. Conclusion
Based on these results, CatBoost outperforms CART in predicting pancreatic cancer diagnosis. It demonstrates higher accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-scores across all classes. The confusion matrix of CatBoost shows fewer misclassifications, indicating more reliable performance. CatBoost is recommended for this dataset and application.

## II. Supervised - Regression (House Dataset)

### A. Project Code File
- [Project Code Link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1etSnRVov-EI1PMfjv5a7MKFVAtXr_Bur?usp=sharing)

### B. Dataset Information
This dataset includes details about house size, number of bedrooms, floors, age, and price.

### C. Compare 2 Models (SGDRegressor and LinearRegression)
#### 1. Evaluation Metrics
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**:
  - SGDRegressor: 439.67
  - LinearRegression: 439.42

- **R^2 Score**:
  - SGDRegressor: 0.96
  - LinearRegression: 0.96

### D. Conclusion
Both models perform similarly in terms of MSE and R^2 score. LinearRegression has a slight edge due to marginally lower MSE. Either model can be considered effective for predicting house prices based on this dataset.

## III. Unsupervised - Clustering (Mall Customers Dataset)

### A. Project Code File
- [Project Code Link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1xI7qbq_DsAOzXvA_1tupJO06YHrLYMbC?usp=sharing)

### B. Dataset Information
This dataset contains information about mall customers, including annual income and spending score.

### C. Compare 2 Models (Hierarchical Clustering and KMeans Clustering)
#### 1. Evaluation Metrics
- **Silhouette Score**:
  - Hierarchical Clustering: 0.4259
  - KMeans Clustering: 0.2114

- **Davies-Bouldin Score**:
  - Hierarchical Clustering: 0.7198
  - KMeans Clustering: 4.4389

- **Calinski-Harabasz Score**:
  - Hierarchical Clustering: 221.1333
  - KMeans Clustering: 116.3490

### D. Conclusion
Hierarchical Clustering performs better than KMeans in clustering mall customers based on their income and spending score. It shows higher Silhouette Scores, lower Davies-Bouldin Indices, and higher Calinski-Harabasz Indices, indicating better-defined and more distinct clusters.

### A. Project Code File
- [Project Code Link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1HbVpyfFpk_4ghKt4Txs4wEOISuq_eYjK?usp=sharing)

### B. Dataset Information
This dataset includes various attributes of colleges, including whether they are private or public.

### C. Compare 2 Models (Hierarchical Clustering and KMeans Clustering)
#### 1. Evaluation Metrics
- **Silhouette Score**:
  - Hierarchical Clustering: 0.437
  - KMeans Clustering: 0.560

- **Davies-Bouldin Score**:
  - Hierarchical Clustering: 1.112
  - KMeans Clustering: 1.133

- **Calinski-Harabasz Score**:

  - KMeans Clustering: 379.587

#### 2. Classification Reports
- **Hierarchical Clustering**:
  - Accuracy: 90%
  - Precision (public colleges): 0.93
  - Precision (private colleges): 0.89
  - Recall (public colleges): 0.68
  - Recall (private colleges): 0.98
